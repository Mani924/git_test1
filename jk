### Policy Description:

The **K8sPSPAllowedUsers** policy ensures that pods in a Kubernetes environment run with user and group IDs that fall within the specified allowed ranges. Specifically, for the user ID (`runAsUser`), group ID (`runAsGroup`), supplemental groups (`supplementalGroups`), and filesystem group (`fsGroup`), the policy mandates these values to be within the range of 100 to 200. Containers are not permitted to run as root (user ID 0), unless they are explicitly exempted. The policy also allows for certain container images, as specified in `exemptImages`, to be exempted from these checks.

### Remediation Steps:

If your pods are found to be non-compliant with this policy, start by examining the `securityContext` for each container in your pods. Ensure the values for `runAsUser`, `runAsGroup`, `supplementalGroups`, and `fsGroup` are set and fall within the range of 100 to 200. It's crucial to avoid running containers with a user ID of 0, as running containers as root can introduce significant security risks. If there's a valid reason for a container to run as root, consider adding its image to the `exemptImages` list. In cases where specific `securityContext` fields aren't set at the container level, you can also use the pod-level `securityContext` as a fallback, which will act as a default for all containers within the pod. As a best practice, regularly review the list of exempted images and ensure that only those containers with a genuine reason to bypass the policy are exempted. Finally, for containers that are not in compliance, update their `securityContext` to meet the policy's criteria. Keep in mind that these constraints aim to bolster the security of your Kubernetes deployment. It's essential to ensure that your configurations and policies align with the specific needs and security requirements of your organization.

Current Configuration Description:
The REGO policy output highlights containers not conforming to the user and group ID constraints defined in the K8sPSPAllowedUsers policy. This configuration is taken from the securityContext of the containers and pods in the Kubernetes setup, focusing on fields like runAsUser, runAsGroup, supplementalGroups, and fsGroup.

Expected Configuration Description:
The K8sPSPAllowedUsers policy mandates that containers' securityContext values for fields such as runAsUser, runAsGroup, supplementalGroups, and fsGroup should lie between 100 and 200. Containers must not run as root (User ID: 0) unless exempted. If these settings aren't given at the container level, the podâ€™s securityContext is used. Some containers with specified images in exemptImages are exceptions to these rules.
