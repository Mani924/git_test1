Of course! The provided Rego policy enforces restrictions related to user and group identities within Kubernetes pods. Let's provide a concise policy description and recommended remediation steps:

---

### Policy Description:

**Name:** K8sPSPAllowedUsers

**Objective:** Ensure pods run with user and group IDs within the specified allowed ranges.

**Details:**

- **User ID (`runAsUser`) Constraints:** 
  - The user ID under which the pod's containers run must be within the range 100 to 200.
  - If `runAsUser` is not provided, it must default to a value within the specified range.
  - Containers that run as root (user ID 0) are not permitted unless explicitly exempted.

- **Group ID (`runAsGroup`) Constraints:** 
  - The group ID under which the pod's containers run must be within the range 100 to 200.

- **Supplemental Groups (`supplementalGroups`) Constraints:** 
  - Any supplemental group IDs associated with the pod must be within the range 100 to 200.

- **Filesystem Group (`fsGroup`) Constraints:** 
  - The fsGroup (representing the group ID for volumes) must be within the range 100 to 200.

**Exemptions:** Containers with certain images (as defined in `exemptImages`) are exempted from these checks.

### Remediation Steps:

1. **Check Your Pod Specifications:**
   - Examine the `securityContext` for each container in your pods. Ensure the `runAsUser`, `runAsGroup`, `supplementalGroups`, and `fsGroup` are set within the range 100 to 200.

2. **Avoid Running as Root:**
   - Avoid running containers with a user ID of 0 unless absolutely necessary. Running containers as root can pose a security risk. If running as root is necessary, consider adding the container's image to the `exemptImages` list.

3. **Use Pod-Level `securityContext` as a Fallback:**
   - If specific `securityContext` fields are not set at the container level, ensure they are set at the pod level. This will act as a default for all containers within the pod.

4. **Review Exempted Images:**
   - Ensure that images listed under `exemptImages` truly need exemptions. Limit exemptions to only those containers that have a valid reason to bypass the policy.

5. **Update Non-Compliant Containers:** 
   - Update the `securityContext` of non-compliant containers to align with the policy constraints. This may involve changing the user or group IDs or adding supplemental groups.

6. **Stay Informed:** 
   - Periodically review the policy constraints to ensure they align with your organization's security requirements and best practices.

Remember, this policy is designed to enhance the security of your Kubernetes environment by ensuring that pods run with restricted user and group identities. Always ensure your policies align with the specific needs and security requirements of your organization.
